# VBA-challenge

This repository contains the VBA script created to do the following:
  - Consolidate the information regarding all stocks in a given year so that each stock's progress/information for a given year was contained in a single line.
  - Calculate the yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock.
  - For each year, identify the stock with the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume.

The code is written so that this can be completed on all sheets by running it once, rather than on each sheet separately.

Each of the screenshots shows the beginning of the results for each year.  The Excel file was too large to upload to this repository.  Please reach out if more information is needed.
